# Trivial Password Manager

Fork form https://github.com/nmeum/tpm now called the Trivial Password Manager instead of Tiny.  While I greatly like the original tpm I am used to some of pass' comfort and thus I implemented it.

## What's different?

* Support for find, edit and rm
* Shows by default all existing entries
* Complete rewrite of the man page in mdoc(7)
* Use GPG Version 1 instead of Version 2
* Uses colortree/tree to display all entries
* Completion for OpenBSD's ksh

## Installation

Clone the repo and execute `make install` as root.  Have a look at the EXAMPLES section in the man page for further details.

## Contact

Contact me directly if you find bugs, etc.
